Welcome to GenLINK! 

GenLINK is an application where seniors can be matched with younger members of society, which we call "friends", based off their matched interests. Lonliness is prevalent in seniors living in the U.S and we wanted to fix this problem by providing an accessible link between these seniors and the younger generation.

To use GenLINK, you must register if you are a new user. It will ask you for your basic information and ask if you are signing up for a Senior account or Friend account. Once you are registered, you are able to pick multiple hobbies that you are interested in or have. Based off your choices, you can see which person you have matched with.

If you are an existing user, you may log in with your account information and see all your current hobby selections. You may add or delete hobbies and see who you have matched up with.

Enjoy!
